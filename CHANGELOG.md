# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **New plugin: xdmtracker** — transforms declarative tracking definitions into Adobe XDM payloads and sends them via `alloy("sendEvent", ...)`
  - `define(definition, options)` — load a tracking definition keyed by ACDL event names
  - `track(event)` — pass an ACDL event; the plugin auto-resolves the event name and component state
  - Modular architecture: `paths.js`, `resolve.js`, `aa-mapping.js`, `xdm-builder.js`, `payload.js`
- **Plugin context: `catch`** — the core `catch(event).get()` function is now available to all plugins via `context.catch`
- **README: table of contents** — clickable index at the top for quick navigation
- **README: code conventions section** — documents the snake_case convention
